    <p>While visiting Shihiri you can expect to see landscaping that defies the laws of gravity.
    Our waterfalls flow upwards, our trees illuminate at night due to the sun rays they absorb 
    during the day and we have the most luxurious sky homes you could ever imagine.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's always recommended to take a tour of our sky home district while you're in town. 
        These luxurious homes sit above the clouds providing ultimate privacy and the cleanest 
        air quality Shihiri has to offer. These sky homes sit atop our self illuminated trees 
        and are constructed out of pure gold and quartz. These rare homes extend down into the tree 
        which has been hollowed out to create more space and privacy than the rooms that are more 
        visibility seen above ground.
